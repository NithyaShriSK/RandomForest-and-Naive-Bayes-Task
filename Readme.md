# Random Forest & Naïve Bayes Classification Tasks

Welcome to the **Random Forest & Naïve Bayes Classification Tasks** repository! This project demonstrates how to implement and compare two popular machine learning classifiers—Random Forest and Naïve Bayes—across multiple real-world datasets using Jupyter notebooks.

##  Repository Overview

| Notebook             | Dataset Used              | Task                             |
|----------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------------|
| `spam.ipynb`         | `synthetic_spam.csv`       | Spam vs. Ham Classification      |
| `mushroom.ipynb`     | `mushrooms.csv`            | Edible vs. Poisonous Classification |
| `survived.ipynb`     | `gender_submission.csv`    | Titanic Survival Prediction      |
| `credit_card.ipynb`  | `UCI_Credit_Card.csv`      | Credit Card Default Prediction   |

The `venv` folder sets up a virtual environment; dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

##  Getting Started

1. **Clone this repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NithyaShriSK/RandomForest-and-Naive-Bayes-Task.git
   cd RandomForest-and-Naive-Bayes- Task


Create and activate a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows


Install required packages:

pip install -r requirements.txt


Launch Jupyter Notebooks:

jupyter notebook


Navigate to the .ipynb files in your browser.

What’s Inside?

requirements.txt — Lists necessary libraries like scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy.

Jupyter Notebooks — Clean and well-documented analyses showcasing data preprocessing, model training, evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix), and comparisons.

Datasets — Real-world examples for hands-on exploration.

Why This Matters

Comparative Insight — See how Random Forest stacks up against Naïve Bayes across diverse classification tasks.

Reproducible Learning — Jupyter notebooks walk you through code and results step-by-step.

Educational Utility — Ideal for students, enthusiasts, or developers curious about classification algorithms in action.

Quick Start Guide

Open any notebook such as mushroom.ipynb, then:

Load and explore the dataset

Preprocess features and labels

Split into training/test sets

Trainmodels using:

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB


Evaluate performance with accuracy_score, confusion_matrix, and visual comparisons

Recommendations

If you’re enjoying this project, consider:

Adding more datasets (e.g. iris, diabetes)

Exploring hyperparameter tuning (GridSearchCV)

Adding visualizations (like confusion matrix heatmaps, ROC curves)

Contributing improvements or new examples
